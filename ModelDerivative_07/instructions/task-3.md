# Task 3 – Translate Source File

To display a model in the viewer, you must translate the model to a viewer-friendly format. There are two formats you can translate the source model to;

- The SVF format
- The SVF2 format

SVF is the format originally designed for the viewer. The SVF2 format is an improved version of SVF. It is optimized for larger models so that they load faster at display time. However, translation to SVF2 can take longer than translation to SVF. For details refer [Displaying Models in a Browser](http://forge.autodesk.com) in the Model Derivative API Developer's Guide.


To continue with this task, pick one of the following options:

- Option 1: [Translate to SVF](task-3_op1.md)
- Option 2: [Translate to SVF2](task-3_op2.md)
