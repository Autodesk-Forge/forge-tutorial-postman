This folder contains a Postman Collection that contains the requests used in the Model Derivative Step-by-Step Tutorial [Extract Metadata from a Source File](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/tutorials/xtract-metadata/), which is published on the Forge portal. 

In the Postman sidebar, requests are stored in folders that have the same name as the corresponding task in the tutorial on the Forge portal.

Individual requests in Postman have been named such that the corresponding step in the tutorial (on the Forge Portal) can be figured out easily.
