# API Documentation Postman Collection Git Repo

This repository contains several tutorials that teach you how to use Forge APIs. The Forge Portal also contains Step-by-Step tutorials for the same purpose. The tutorials on Forge use [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) to send HTTP requests to Forge, while the tutorials in this repository use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). The tutorials on the Forge portal and this repository demonstrate the same workflows. They differ only by the tool used to send HTTP requests.

Currently, this repository contains tutorials for the following:

- [Design Automation for Revit](DA4Revit)
- [Design Automation for 3ds Max](DA43dsMax)

## What's Postman?

Postman is a popular tool that provides an easy-to-use interface to send HTTP requests. Postman is able to parse the responses that Forge sends you and save response parameter values to variables. These parameters can then be reused in subsequent requests through these variables. The Postman collections in this repository use this ability to provide pre-populated HTTP requests to help you follow the tutorial workflow with minimal effort. You can also modify the requests and experiment without having to write a single line of code. 

- You can learn how to install and use Postman from [here](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates).

- You can download the Postman installer from [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).
